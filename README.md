To install a theme:

1. Open the Extensions tab (`Ctrl + Shift + X`)
2. Search for the theme name
3. Click **Install**, then go to `Preferences > Color Theme` to activate it

### Customization Tips

#### Change Font & Size

Go to `File > Preferences > Settings` (or press `Ctrl + ,`) and search for:

- **Editor: Font Family** – Set your preferred font (e.g., `Fira Code`, `JetBrains Mono`, etc.)
- **Editor: Font Size** – Adjust font size for better readability

#### Enable Ligatures

If using a font like **Fira Code**, enable ligatures by adding this in your `settings.json`:

```json
"editor.fontLigatures": true
````

#### Configure Icons

Use the `vscode-icons` extension for beautiful file/folder icons:

```bash
ext install vscode-icons
```

Then, enable it with:

```json
"workbench.iconTheme": "vscode-icons"
```

#### Customize Settings via JSON

You can fully control VS Code behavior by editing the `settings.json` file:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`)
2. Type: `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`

Example:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorTheme": "GitHub Dark",
  "editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true,
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "workbench.iconTheme": "vscode-icons"
}
```

### Bonus: Live Preview Customization

* Install **Live Server** extension for real-time HTML/CSS preview
* You can customize behavior in workspace or global settings

With themes and customization, you can turn VS Code into an efficient, visually pleasing development environment that matches your style perfectly.

## DEBUGGING

VS Code offers a powerful built-in debugging experience that supports multiple languages and environments. With a clean interface and flexible configuration, you can debug your code efficiently without leaving the editor.

### Why Use VS Code for Debugging?

- Integrated terminal and console
- Real-time variable inspection
- Breakpoints, watch expressions, and call stack view
- Seamless integration with Node.js, Python, PHP, and more
- Custom launch configurations for various environments

### Getting Started with Debugging

1. Open your project folder
2. Go to the **Run and Debug** panel (`Ctrl + Shift + D`)
3. Click on **"Run and Debug"** or create a custom configuration (`launch.json`)
4. Add breakpoints by clicking to the left of line numbers in the code editor
5. Hit ▶️ **Start Debugging**

### Configuring `launch.json`

To create or edit configurations:

1. Open the **Run and Debug** panel
2. Click **create a `launch.json` file**
3. Select the environment (Node.js, PHP, Python, etc.)
4. Customize as needed

Example for **Node.js**:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Launch App",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
    }
  ]
}
````

Example for **PHP (using Xdebug)**:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9003
    }
  ]
}
```

> Tip: For PHP, install the **PHP Debug** extension and make sure Xdebug is properly configured on your server.

### Debugging Tips

* Use `console.log()` wisely, but prefer breakpoints for cleaner debugging
* Use **Watch** panel to monitor specific expressions or variables
* Use **Step Over (F10)** and **Step Into (F11)** for precise flow control
* Right-click in the variable section to **"Set Value"** during debugging
* Debug tests or scripts directly from `launch.json` or the explorer

### Debugging Other Languages

* **Python**: Install the **Python** extension and it will auto-generate launch configurations.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Works natively.
* **PHP**: Requires Xdebug setup.
* **C/C++**: Requires the **C/C++** extension by Microsoft.
* **.NET**: Use the **C#** extension for .NET Core debugging.

Debugging in VS Code is intuitive, flexible, and extendable. With the right setup, you can reduce bugs faster and improve your overall development experience.
