- **Editor: Font Family** – Set your preferred font (e.g., `Fira Code`, `JetBrains Mono`, etc.)
- **Editor: Font Size** – Adjust font size for better readability

#### Enable Ligatures

If using a font like **Fira Code**, enable ligatures by adding this in your `settings.json`:

```json
"editor.fontLigatures": true
````

#### Configure Icons

Use the `vscode-icons` extension for beautiful file/folder icons:

```bash
ext install vscode-icons
```

Then, enable it with:

```json
"workbench.iconTheme": "vscode-icons"
```

#### Customize Settings via JSON

You can fully control VS Code behavior by editing the `settings.json` file:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`)
2. Type: `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`

Example:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorTheme": "GitHub Dark",
  "editor.fontFamily": "Fira Code",
  "editor.fontLigatures": true,
  "editor.fontSize": 14,
  "workbench.iconTheme": "vscode-icons"
}
```

### 🧙‍♂Bonus: Live Preview Customization

* Install **Live Server** extension for real-time HTML/CSS preview
* You can customize behavior in workspace or global settings

With themes and customization, you can turn VS Code into an efficient, visually pleasing development environment that matches your style perfectly.
